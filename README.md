Blog about Memopol and its news. In Pelican.

#config
You'll need to change some config settings, like the folder, the username, the theme folder.

#theme
The theme used is foundation-memopol, based on foundation-default-colors, and modified by me.

#plugins
I use the pin to top plugin to have a sticky article on homepage.
It's already on github, here : https://github.com/Shaked/pin_to_top
