# Roadmap

## Two goals
* We want people to help : so let's ease the documentation/installation part
* Separate more core/modules : we want other NGOs to use Memopol, not just us

## Basic features for /core :

* Up to date data toolchain using django-representatives (compotista) and toutatis (for votes)

* Interface for owner of the instance to search for votes, then add voting recommendations on it with preview

* 3 points of view on the data :
    - by voting recommendations
    - by country/groups/politicals parties
    - by individuals
(these are the 3 ways you'll want to look at the data we use)

Already having all of that would be a very good start and a lot of work.
