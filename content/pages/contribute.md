# Roadmap

## Two goals
* We want people to help : so let's ease the documentation/installation part
* Separate more core/modules : we want other NGOs to use Memopol, not just us

## Our next steps
- A complete redesign of the home page: it is the most important aspect. It's the crucial starting point for all the website. We need it :
    - to be a helpful stepping stone both to citizens discovering the tool *and* to experienced activists
    - to be visually attractive
    - to show useful information, data (dataviz)
    - to make it quickly obvious what Memopol is and what its purpose is
    - to offer the possibility to easily post a new “public position” by a MEP
- A redesign of the MEP (Member of the European Parliament) pages:
    - overview of the MEP, with adminitrative information
    - MEP score 
    - latest public positions with a link to a more complete list
    - Data visualization about their MEP's score (beautiful graphs, evolution of score, ...) (dataviz)
    - A quick summary widget of the MEP, showing the most important information, easily re-usable on other websites
