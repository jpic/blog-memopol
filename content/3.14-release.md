### Memopol's back online !

A new version of Memopol has been released, [LQDN's instance is up](http://lqdn.memopol.eu) and [documentation has been released](http://memopol.rtfd.org).

A gigantic amount of work has been done since the last release (when was it?), mostly an almost full rewrite of code, as well as a simplification of the installation process. A new design is currently being integrated, as well as previous votes recommendations to start giving MEPs notes.

Parsing votes from assemblies websites is now working, and it gets easier to keep tabs on MEPs, the one who defends our positions and the one who opposes them. Meaning, it will get easier for people to influence in a positive way the legislative work.

### Ongoing work

The current developments are ongoing:

- support for French assembly and senate, using data from
  [FranceData](https://github.com/SocieteCitoyenne/FranceData) which uses data
  from [NosDéputés](https://www.nosdeputes.fr/) itself for representatives, and
  includes a parser to scrape votes from the assembly's website,aa
- administration experience improvement: real-time sync of proposals for
  Dossiers which are part of the ongoing campaigns, and email notifications for
  administrators when a new proposal is created so that they can setup the
  recommendation appropriately.

### We're looking for volunteers !

- administrators to [manage the website](http://memopol.readthedocs.org/en/pr/usage.html), the first task is
  to integrate recommendations from the previous version of memopol into this
  one, this is a manual task because the data sets are completely
  incompatible.
- an HTML developer willing to learn some Python and Django to integrate v3
  design, work has been started on the [v3
  branch](https://github.com/political-memory/political_memory/tree/v3), that
  branch is under [CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery) on a
  [dev instance](https://v3-memopol.rhcloud.com).
- anyone willing to participate is welcome on the IRC channel, `#lqdn-memopol`
  on freenode.
