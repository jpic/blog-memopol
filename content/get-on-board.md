Hi everyone,

As some of you may know, we are relaunching active development of our tool Memopol (aka “Mémoire Politique” or “Political Memory”). Our goal is for it to become a clear, simple and usable (by regular humans) web site.

Memopol, for those of you who may not know, is among other things a tool that helped us win the battle against ACTA, both on the ground (it help to quickly find MEPs offices in the Brussels Parliament building, for instance) and by helping all the citizens who contacted MEPs by phone or mail (Memopol gave them contact details and information about the MEPs political position).

It is a wonderful campaigning and open data tool, which deserves to be developped to its full potential. We think it could be a lot better than it is right now, and we want to make it the best it can be!

To that end, we recently organized a meeting to do some brainstorming about what we should prioritize in terms of Memopol development. We ended with a great roadmap: [that you can read here](https://wiki.laquadrature.net/Projects/Memopol/Roadmap/).

And quota_atypique also gave the Memopol blog a new coat of paint and a good refresh.

So now, we need as many people as possible to help out, we are looking forward to all your talents, skills and enthusiasm to turn our vision of the next version of Memopol into reality \o/

Our next steps:

- A complete redesign of the home page: it is the most important aspect. It's the crucial starting point for all the website. We need it :
    - to be a helpful stepping stone both to citizens discovering the tool *and* to experienced activists
    - to be visually attractive
    - to show useful information, data (dataviz)
    - to make it quickly obvious what Memopol is and what its purpose is
    - to offer the possibility to easily post a new “public position” by a MEP
- A redesign of the MEP (Member of the European Parliament) pages:
    - overview of the MEP, with adminitrative information
    - MEP score 
    - latest public positions with a link to a more complete list
    - Data visualization about their MEP's score (beautiful graphs, evolution of score, ...) (dataviz)
    - A quick summary widget of the MEP, showing the most important information, easily re-usable on other websites


So, we need graphic designers, readers, data-visualizators (is that a word?), and more generally your opinions and thoughts about the version we are building now, etc...

Feel free to join and answer so we can talk about all this!

Thanks and datalove from the Memopol team!
