### Memopol Mini-Hackathon

After the Memopol 3.14 [Relaunch Event on 14th April](http://mediakit.laquadrature.net/embed/2390), the developers didn't rest !

A mini-hackathon has enabled much progress on both importing data from French parliament chambers as well as having a way of handling multiple chambers at once, from several data sources !

Each list of groups and representatives now shows the chamber the data comes from.

Those improvements will soon be available on a test instance of Memopol to enable users to test them and suggest other features and means to use the newly available data :)

As said before, don't hesitate to contribute or suggest ideas for the project:

* On github : [github.com/political-memory/political_memory](https://github.com/political-memory/political_memory)
* On IRC : `#lqdn-memopol` on Freenode
